# caas_aspace_stylesheets

A repository to hold both SI-customized and core ArchivesSpace stylesheets and supporting fonts, logos, etc. for the Staff User Interface (SUI) xml and pdf processes.  This repo should remain complete with all core and custom files needed for these processes so that it can be cloned down into any ArchivesSpace installation's `stylesheets/` directory without any need for additional setup of configuration.

Currently customized files:

- as-ead-pdf.xsl
- fop-config.xsl

Added by SI:

- ASpaceCleanup.xsl
- ASpacePreprocess.xsl
- ead_components.xsl
- logos/
